Given an array of integers, the algorithm arranges them in order to form the largest possible integer. Assume only positive integers.

Use C# .NET/ASP.NET to write a REST API to implement the algorithm and deploy it as Azure function on Azure.

example: {input: [10,223,78,90,99]} , expected output:{output: "99907822310"}
